# Consent As a Service API

The API provides organisations & services with the tools and data they need to request, read, view and disable consents.
The project is OpenSource and can be viewed at GitHub (SOURCE).

The API itself is built on top of a RPC architecture with a gateway server designed to handle requests made by users and organisations. You can request it directly using HTTP(S) requests or use our client

## JavaScript Client

The client is built using TypeScript although support using other platforms is being considered.
We've kept it simple (just a script tag!) so that you can easily embed it into your site.
Alternatively, developers can download the NPM package to allow for deeper integration with their site.

## Java Client

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  The Java Client is only designed to work with Spring Cloud Servers to view consent statuses and read data
</Callout>
The Java Client can be added to your project using Maven or Gradle and will allow Server applications to communicate with the ConsentAsAService platform.
